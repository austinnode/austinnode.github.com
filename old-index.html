	    	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	    	<p>This is the home page for the new Austin Node Usergroup. We will be having our first meetup on July 12th, 2012. We need:
	    		<ul>
	    			<li><span class="bold">Sponsors:</span> we need some great sponsors! We will put their logos up on this site, and they will have a few minutes at the beginning of the meetup to announce that they're hiring, talk about what they do, anything really. Also, undying gratitude from this new meetup organizer.</li>
	    			<li><span class="bold">A Venue:</span> we would like the meetup to be downtown, so if you know anyone, let us know!</li>
	    			<li><span class="bold">A Speaker:</span> we do in fact need a speaker for July. Special interest in a speaker who is running node in production, but we're open to all proposals.</li>
	    		</ul>
	    	<p>If you have or are any of these things, please contact me at admin@austinnode.com or ping @atxnode</p>
	    	<p>If you are interested in joining up, there is a meetup link in the header. The more, the merrier!</p>
